# Application of the ANFIS Neuro-Fuzzy model for the classification of obesity in children and adolescents
The objective of this article is to classify obesity in boys and adolescents, between 6 and 17 years old, using Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. The neuro-diffuse model ANFIS
(Fuzzy Inference System of the Artificial Neural Network) was chosen, which is in the toolbox of Matlab. ANFIS includes a complete set of features for both the fuzzification, de-fuzzification, training and testing. Experimental tests show a 96.96% accuracy in classification and 3.04% error.
